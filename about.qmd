A list of things I like to do:

## Snowboarding
Snowboarding was something I always wanted to try but never thought I’d have the time or money to fully commit to. Three years ago, I finally took the leap—I bought a season pass and a complete setup. Since then, it’s become a yearly tradition. My favorite resorts are Kirkwood and Sierra-at-Tahoe, and I can confidently hit rails, boxes, and small jumps. It’s my favorite way to disconnect and escape into the mountains for a day.

## Basketball
Growing up, I tried a bit of everything—soccer, football, volleyball—but basketball was the one that stuck. I played for my school from elementary through high school, and even spent a couple years in AAU. These days, I still keep the game alive by playing intramurals at university with my friends. It’s all about staying active and having fun now.

## ValleySoles
I never really saw myself as an entrepreneur—until one random day during the COVID lockdown. Stuck at home and looking for ways to make some extra cash, I combined my love for sneakers with a bit of hustle. I started by buying used shoes, cleaning them up, and reselling them. As things picked up, I launched my brand, ValleySoles, and began using online software to automate checkouts. What started as a side hobby ended up replacing my part-time job and opened the door to a whole new world of opportunity.
