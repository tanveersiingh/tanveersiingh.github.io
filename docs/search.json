Three years ago, I finally took the leap—I bought a season pass and a complete setup. Since then, it’s become a yearly tradition. My favorite resorts are Kirkwood and Sierra-at-Tahoe, and I can confidently hit rails, boxes, and small jumps. It’s my favorite way to disconnect and escape into the mountains for a day."

I played for my school from elementary through high school, and even spent a couple years in AAU. These days, I still keep the game alive by playing intramurals at university with my friends. It’s all about staying active and having fun now."

Stuck at home and looking for ways to make some extra cash, I combined my love for sneakers with a bit of hustle. I started by buying used shoes, cleaning them up, and reselling them. As things picked up, I launched my brand, ValleySoles, and began using online software to automate checkouts. What started as a side hobby ended up replacing my part-time job and opened the door to a whole new world of opportunity."
